**A:**  
1. Unzip the downloaded `.zip` file.

     `Library > Application Support > Blackmagic Design > DaVinci Resolve > LUT`  
   - **Premiere Pro / After Effects**:  
     `Documents > Adobe > Common > LUTs > Creative`  
   - **Final Cut Pro**:  
     Use MotionVFX or manually import via "Custom LUT" effect.  
3. Restart the software and the LUTs should appear in the LUT list.
